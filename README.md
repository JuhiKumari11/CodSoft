<h1> Task-1 Number Game</h1>
The program generates a random number between 1 and 100.It asks the user to guess the number. It prompts the user to enter a guess and provides feedback if the guess is too high, too low, or correct. The game continues until the player guesses the correct number. It tracks the number of attempts made by the player and displays the result once  the correct guess is achieved. The code includes error handling to ensure valid input from the user.

<h1> Task-2 Student Grade Calculator </h1>
The program prompts the user to input student marks.
It reads the marks entered by the user.
Based on the marks, the program calculates the grade using conditional checks.
If marks are 90 or more, the grade is "A".
For marks 75-89, the grade is "B", and so on, with "F" for marks below 50.

<h1> Task-3 ATM Interface</h1>
The Java ATM interface code defines an interface ATM with methods for depositing money, withdrawing funds, and checking the account balance. The ATMImpl class implements this interface, providing the actual functionality for each method. The deposit() method adds the specified amount to the balance, while the withdraw() method checks if the balance is sufficient before deducting the requested amount. The checkBalance() method simply returns the current balance of the account. This structure allows users to interact with a simulated ATM system, performing basic operations like deposits, withdrawals, and balance inquiries.

<h1> Task-4 Currency Converter </h1>
The currency converter code allows users to convert one currency to another using predefined conversion rates. The program prompts the user to enter the amount and select the currencies they wish to convert from and to. It uses a method to perform the conversion based on a specified rate and displays the result. The conversion logic can be easily modified to include different currencies and rates. This simple application provides a basic interface for converting currencies by multiplying the input amount with the appropriate exchange rate.

<h1> Task-5 Student Management System </h1> 
The student management system code allows for storing and managing student details like name, roll number, and grades. It typically uses a class to represent student data and methods to add, update, or delete student records. The system may include a menu-driven interface to interact with the user, allowing for operations like displaying student information or calculating grades. Data is often stored in a collection such as an array or list for easy retrieval. This basic system helps manage and organize student data, providing essential features like adding records, updating information, and viewing student details.
